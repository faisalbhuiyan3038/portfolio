## Overview

Save Link Collections is a Firefox browser extension that bridges the gap between Firefox's mobile and desktop experiences. Inspired by Firefox Android's collections feature, this addon enables users to create, manage, and sync their link collections across devices. The primary motivation was to provide desktop users with the ability to maintain organized link collections similar to the mobile experience, while also offering a simple way to transfer collections between devices.

## Key Features

### Collection Management
- Create named collections of website links
- Import multiple URLs via comma-separated input
- Edit existing collections through a text-based interface
- No artificial limits on collection size or number

### Browser Integration
- Copy all open tab URLs via context menu
- Seamless popup interface for quick access
- Dedicated pages for advanced features

### Data Portability
- Export collections as JSON files for backup
- Import collections from JSON files
- Cross-device compatibility between Firefox Desktop and Android

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Storage**: Browser Storage API
- **Data Structure**: Array-based storage for straightforward data management
- **UI Components**:
  - Popup interface for regular operations
  - Dedicated pages for backup/restore functionality
  - Context menu integration for tab URL capture

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
The addon maintains consistent functionality across Firefox Desktop and Android platforms, with the only variation being UI sizing adjustments for different screen formats. Special consideration was given to browser API compatibility, implementing fallback solutions where necessary.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Android Compatibility
**Problem**: Initial implementation of JSON backup/restore functionality failed on Firefox Android despite working correctly on desktop.
**Solution**: Implemented an iframe-based workaround to ensure consistent behavior across platforms while maintaining functionality within Firefox's security model.

### Challenge 2: Performance Optimization
**Problem**: Need to comply with Firefox's performance requirements for addon approval.
**Solution**: Implemented efficient data structures and optimized storage operations to meet Firefox's performance guidelines.

### Challenge 3: Cross-Platform UI
