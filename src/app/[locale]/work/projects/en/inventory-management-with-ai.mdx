## Overview

Smart Inventory Management is an innovative web application developed during a Headstarter fellowship program. The project demonstrates the practical integration of artificial intelligence into everyday business applications, specifically focusing on streamlining inventory management through automated item recognition.

The primary motivation behind the project was to reduce manual data entry in inventory systems while exploring AI integration capabilities. By leveraging Google's Gemini AI, the application can automatically identify items through camera input, making inventory management more efficient and user-friendly.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- Real-time inventory management with add/remove capabilities
- Quantity adjustment with automatic item removal at zero
- Search functionality for quick item location
- Responsive design supporting both mobile and desktop interfaces

### AI-Powered Innovation
- Camera integration for photo capture
- Automated item recognition using Google Gemini AI
- Intelligent inventory updates based on AI identification
- Support for multiple camera devices with device switching capability

## Technical Implementation
